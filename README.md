## RESTful Angular 2 application

A RESTful master-detail application built using Angular 2.

### Getting Started

There are two main parts to this application. The first is the server, for which we are using `json-server` to simulate a REST api. The second part is the Angular 2 application which we will use `webpack-dev-server` to display.  

To get started run the commands below.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/simpulton/angular2-rest-app.git
$ cd angular2-rest-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser.
